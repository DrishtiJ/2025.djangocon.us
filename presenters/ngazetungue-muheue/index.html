<p>I am an open-source software advocate, community leader in Africa, software engineer, PSF Fellow, and DSF member. I co-founded the Python community and founded the Django community in Namibia, where I’ve helped introduce open-source technologies to new developers and supported underrepresented groups in tech across Africa. For more than a decade, I’ve worked to grow these communities and have been involved in the global Python and Ubuntu communities, speaking at international events about open source and building strong tech communities.</p>
<p>I help organize major events like PyCon Africa and DjangoCon Africa, bringing together developers and industry leaders from across Africa and beyond. I’m passionate about sharing knowledge, encouraging collaboration, and promoting open-source software.</p>
<p>I’m part of The Crazy Labs; Laloka Labs LLC, where I continue to support innovation and open-source work in Africa and around the world.</p>
