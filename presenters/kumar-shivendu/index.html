<p>Hi, I'm a Python and Rust engineer with a deep interest in search engines, AI, and open source. I started programming at 13 and have been working full-time as a software engineer for the past 3 years. I currently work for <a href="https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant">Qdrant</a>, the most loved OSS vector database.</p>
<p>Django has been a core part of my development journey and I've used it extensively across projects and organizations. I'm passionate about building open-source developer tools and sharing knowledge through talks on topics that matter to me.</p>
<p>Based in Bangalore (India), I enjoy discovering global cultures and cuisines.</p>
