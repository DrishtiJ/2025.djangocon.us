<p>Hey there! I'm Manish Tekam, a passionate software developer who's been riding the Django wave for over 2 years!<br>
Currently, I'm part of the awesome team at Spotter AI, where I get to build cool stuff and solve interesting problems every day. My journey with Django has been like a great adventure - from writing my first &quot;Hello World&quot; to building complex web applications that make a real difference.</p>
