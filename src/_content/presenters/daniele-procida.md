I am a Director of Engineering at Canonical, where I lead documentation practice. I enjoy helping organise community conferences for Python and Django. That includes multiple editions of DjangoCon Europe, as well as the first editions of PyCon Africa and DjangoCon Africa.

I also enjoy helping people and open-source projects improve their documentation.
