Kasey is Director of UX at Lincoln Loop, where he has worked since in 2016. With a work history and education in traditional Graphic Design, he's most at-home building flexible design systems that breathe personality into marketing/CMS projects and software products alike.

Kasey has worked with Django since 2007, when he started a small web agency in Ohio with his brother. He's been writing CSS long enough to remember getting excited about rounded corners in Firefox 2.0 and wrestling Internet Explorer 6 to submission. When he's not working, he's equally at home cooking for friends, drawing with his two girls, or playing his guitar.
