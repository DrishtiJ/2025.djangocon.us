Simon Willison is the creator of Datasette, an open source tool for exploring and publishing data. He currently works full-time developing open source tools for data journalism, built around Datasette and SQLite.

Simon has spent the last year and a half deeply immersed in the world of Large Language Models, trying to solve the fascinating problems of how to responsibly use the technology in the two fields he knows best: journalism and software engineering.

Prior to becoming an independent open source developer, Simon was an engineering director at Eventbrite. Simon joined Eventbrite through their acquisition of Lanyrd, a Y Combinator funded company he co-founded in 2010.

He is a board member of the Python Software Foundation and a co-creator of the Django Web Framework, and has been blogging about web development and programming since 2002 at https://simonwillison.net/
