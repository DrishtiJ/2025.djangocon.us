Back in 2019, I participated in Google Summer of Code with Django, during which I implemented the [cross-database `JSONField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#jsonfield) that became available in Django 3.1. Now, I work as a Developer at Torchbox, building new features and improvements to the Django-based [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.org) and its ecosystem.

Outside of the Django world, I maintain my project [giscus](https://giscus.app), a comment system powered by GitHub Discussions. You can find me @laymonage on [GitHub](https://github.com/laymonage), [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@laymonage), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laymonage), and other sites.
