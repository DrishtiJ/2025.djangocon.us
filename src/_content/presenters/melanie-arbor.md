Melanie is a tinkerer, a Python developer, and a coffee lover. She is (mostly) shamelessly mentally ill. She lives in San Diego, California, even though she doesnâ€™t like sand because it always gets in your mouth no matter what you do. She has yet to figure out the correct number of marshmallows to eat.
