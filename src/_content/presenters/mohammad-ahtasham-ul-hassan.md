I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience building and maintaining software applications.
 I'm particularly passionate about web development and AI. For the past 3 years I have been working with edX on the EdTech and e-commerce domain of the application maintaining the current software stack as well as integrating new features.
As an eager learner and explorer, who is constantly seeking new challenges and technologies, I can't wait to learn, share and reconnect with the DjangoCon community.
