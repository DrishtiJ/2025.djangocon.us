This week I had the pleasure of chatting with the DjangoCon US 2025 Conference Chair, Keanya Phelps about her role as Conference Chair and her experience with Django.

## Please tell us a little bit about yourself and your background?

> I’m a mid-life career changer who found my way into tech through a coding bootcamp and it completely changed the trajectory of my life. Before tech, I worked in roles that centered around people, process, and purpose, which now inform how I approach software development, project management, and community building.
>
> I'm passionate about creating spaces where people feel seen and supported, especially those navigating new beginnings, like I once was. Django played a huge role in helping me grow as a developer and find my tech community, so giving back through DjangoCon US feels like coming full circle.
>
> Outside of work, I’m a proud wife and mom (both human and canine!), lover of house music, I’m someone who believes in dancing things out and building people up

## What’s your history with DjangoCon US?

> I attended DjangoCon US Durham in 2023 and 2024. In 2023, I had the opportunity to speak, which was a huge milestone for me as a newer developer in the community. In 2024, I chaired the sprints, where I got to help create an inclusive, collaborative space for folks to contribute to Django and related projects.
>
> I also submitted the proposal to bring DjangoCon US to Chicago in 2025, a city I love. Stepping into the role of Conference Chair this year feels like a chance to turn inspiration into action to help shape the kind of experience that welcomed and motivated me early on.

## What made you want to take on the role of Conference Chair?

> As someone who found a sense of belonging and growth through the Django community, taking on the role of Conference Chair for DjangoCon US 2025 felt like a natural next step in giving back.
>
> I’m passionate about creating spaces where people from all backgrounds feel welcome, included, and inspired.  Especially those newer to tech or from underrepresented communities.
>
> Chairing DjangoCon US in Chicago is an opportunity to shape an experience that reflects the values of collaboration, learning, and inclusion that have been so important in my own journey. Also, I love building things and this time, it’s not just code, but community.

## What’s something unique you’re hoping to bring to DjangoCon US 2025 in Chicago?

> I want DjangoCon US 2025 to feel approachable, relevant, and energizing for everyone from seasoned contributors to first-time attendees. We are hoping to intentionally design for inclusion beyond the basics, creating moments of connection, building bridges between technical and non-technical roles, and spotlighting voices that often go unheard. And since we’re in Chicago, I’m excited to infuse the conference with the energy, grit, and creativity that defines this city.

## What are you most looking forward to at DjangoCon US 2025?

> I'm most looking forward to watching people light up when they make a meaningful connection, or feel truly seen in the Django community. There’s nothing like the energy: hallway chats that turn into collaborations, talks that spark new ideas, and the joy of being surrounded by folks who care about both code and community. I’m excited to help create that atmosphere and to witness the magic that happens when people come together with openness, curiosity, and care.

## What’s one of your favourite memories from a past DjangoCon US?

> One of my favorite memories is the organizer and speaker dinner at DjangoCon US 2024. It was such a great time, being surrounded by people who care  about the community, sharing stories, and laughter. It reminded me how much heart goes into making DjangoCon what it is.
>
> I also loved finally meeting so many of the Djangonauts from DjangoSpace in person. After connecting online, getting to share space with folks I admire and have learned from was so energizing.

## What advice would you give to someone attending DjangoCon US for the first time?

> Come as you are! you belong here. Whether you’re just getting started with Django or have been writing code for years, there’s space for you to learn, share, and connect. Don’t be afraid to introduce yourself, ask questions, or attend a talk that’s outside your comfort zone. Some of the best moments happen in the hallways, over coffee, or during the sprints. And remember, everyone was new once, the speakers, organizers, and core contributors.You’re part of this community just by showing up.

## What’s something people might be surprised to learn about you?

> People are often surprised to learn how I made my way to Tech. I made a mid-life pivot after attending a coding bootcamp. Before that, I worked in roles that were all about problem-solving, organizing, and building relationships, skills I now bring into every tech space I’m in.  Also, I’m a huge fan of house music and will absolutely hit the dance floor if the DJ is right. Dancing helps me recharge and stay grounded, it’s my version of debugging life.

## Any parting words?

> DjangoCon US isn’t just a conference, it’s a community. Whether you’re here to level up your skills, share your story, or simply find your people, I hope you leave feeling more connected, more seen, and more confident in the value you bring.
>
> Keep showing up. Keep asking questions. And don’t underestimate the power of community! it changes careers, and sometimes, it changes lives. I’m so glad you’re here.
