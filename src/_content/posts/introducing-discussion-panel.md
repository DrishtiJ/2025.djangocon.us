We are thrilled to announce the panel discussion for DjangoCon US 2025:

Moderated by **[Velda Kiara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veldakiara/)**, DEFNA Director and long-time open-source community leader, this special anniversary panel brings together key figures from across Django's technical and community landscape. Together, we will reflect on Django's evolution, from its early days to its global adoption and look into what's needed to sustain and grow the Django ecosystem into the future.

The conversation will explore:
- The moments that defined Django's past and the ones shaping its future
- Technical challenges and architectural choices ahead
- What community health really looks like after 20 years
- How different roles, from governance to grassroots organizing, work together to keep Django thriving
- What we should let go of, and what we can't afford to lose
