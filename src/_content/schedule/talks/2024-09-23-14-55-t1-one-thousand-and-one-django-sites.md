title: One Thousand and One Django Sites
track: t1
---

The abstract says it all, however here is a more detailed breakdown of topics:
* Brief background about our hosting business and the types of sites we are hosting.
* Technical architectures (virtual machine vs docker vs cloud etc.)
* Problems of scale (how the heck do you actually keep track of 1,000 websites?!)
* Using Django to host Django (yes, the snake really does eat itself!)
* Financial challenges we have encountered (customers wanting refunds, dealing with cloud provider billing nightmares, how we cut costs, etc.)
* Customer support (the most time-consuming part of the business, and how to reduce the need for support).
* Security nightmares (our own customers attacked us, the rise of A.I. spam bots, dealing with relentless attacks)
