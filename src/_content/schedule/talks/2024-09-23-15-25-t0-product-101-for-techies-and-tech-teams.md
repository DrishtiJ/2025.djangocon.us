title: Product 101 for Techies and Tech Teams
track: t0

In this talk, I intend to cover basic product concepts (more details in the outline) with the goal of sparking engineers' interest in product matters. In my opinion, everyone in tech should be able to speak a little of their colleagues' language so that we can better collaborate and be more efficient as teams. With that said, I think that engineers who would like to become more product-minded will benefit from attending as the talk covers the most common topics in that knowledge domain.
