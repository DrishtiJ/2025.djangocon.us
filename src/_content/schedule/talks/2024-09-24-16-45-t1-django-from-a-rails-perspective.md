title: Django from a Rails Perspective
track: t1
---

As a Rails fanatic, inheriting a mammoth Django application [along with a fresh list of features and upgrades] felt intimidating to the point of impossible. I want to share how I learned Django, what I learned about learning, and light the path for devs to follow my footsteps. For those questioning the value of switching their Rails experts into entirely new frameworks: fluency is valuable, but so is perspective. 

This talk will give you running start for your “translation dictionary”. In order to continue building on that foundation, I’ll provide several strategies for your educational journey. 

Don’t leave your code standard philosophies behind in Rails-land, either! Equipped with all the Django basics, I’ll help you draw direct parallels between Rails/Django for things like: code standards, architecture and technical designs, testing strategies, etc. 

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to software development, yet there is plenty of value of finding a niche and focusing your career/team/company on locking down domain expertise. We shouldn’t default to using the frameworks that feel the most familiar for the sake of our comfort zones; the cost of switching domains can be reduced dramatically with an open mind and a translator!
