When taking on a significant systems upgrade of critical enterprise software, it's rare to have the luxury of building the new application in isolation and then just doing one big data migration.  

This talk will cover the overall architecture of the new system, techniques we are applying to migrate functionality bit by bit, and lessons learned from being in the trenches with this project.

We will cover some strategies for making the transition easy on our employees:

* Setting up a data migration early
* Empathy-first development
* Maintaining in-app roadmap and release notes

We will also get into a few weeds on some technical suggestions that have proved useful from an engineering perspective:

* Reusing annotations
* Staying mindful of query performance
