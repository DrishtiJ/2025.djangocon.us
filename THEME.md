# Theme Customization

`THEME-X` is an identifier that has been used to denote where (some) customization has been made.

## Making changes

Keep an eye on the following:

* Modify key variables in `:root` in `main.css`.
* Look for `THEME-X` comments throughout the codebase and make appropriat changes.
* Be sure to check all graphics, including those within the `theme` folder under `src/assets/`.
* Check favicons in `assets/favicons`.
* Various OpenGraph and social sharing graphics are stored in `assets/img/social`. 
* Check fonts used in `default-social.html` and `default.html`.
* Update fonts and colors in `tailwind.config.js`.

NOTE: Remove unused assets! Delete legacy photos, icons, and more.

Coming from a previous year? Some buttons and graphics may be lingering.

## Design guidelines

1. Sizing, padding, spacing, typography, and general "shape" should stay the same.
2. Colors, fonts, photo treatment, and artistic treatments should be the focus of the theme.
